Note that in older tutorials you may see variable declarations that start with 'var' or no keyword before the variable name (i.e. name = 'Bob'). The best practice in 2021 is to use the keyword 'let'. Variables can also be declared with 'const'. This means a variable cannot be reassigned (otherwise it throws an exception).
